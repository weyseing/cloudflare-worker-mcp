## What does this MR do?

(briefly describe what this MR is about)

## Test Cases

(List all the test case and result. Only need to cater for the changes in Merge Request. If the test cases not required, please write a reason here. Remove example test case below)

1. With a full request parameter, an API <name> will response with http code 200
1. With a valid request parameter, an API <name> will response base on below format  
   ```txt
   tranID,create date,merchantID,channel,status
   123,2022-02-01 02:22:22,shopA,credit,captured
   124,2022-02-01 02:30:48,shopA,mb2u,captured
   125,2022-02-01 03:15:22,shopA,TNG-Wallet,captured
   ```   
1. With a missing parameter tranID, an API <name> will response error code XXXX

### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

(Paste any relevant logs and/or screenshots from your test case. - please use code blocks (```) to format console output, logs, and code as it's very hard to read otherwise.)

### Note for Deployer

- Environment UAT :  
  (Write a message to deployer UAT here if have)

- Environment Production :

#### Risk Analysis

Document: [INFORMATION RISK ASSESSMENT HANDBOOK](https://razermis.sharepoint.com/sites/RMSDocLib/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FRMSDocLib%2FShared%20Documents%2FRMS%20CENTRAL%20REPOSITORY%2FRMS%20IT%20%28%20RMS%2DIT%2Dxx%29%2FRMS%2DIT%2D006%20RMS%20IS%20Risk%20Management%2FRMS%2DIT%2D006%20RMS%20Information%20Risk%20Assessment%20Handbook%202023%201%2E6%20%28part%201%29%20%2D%20signed%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FRMSDocLib%2FShared%20Documents%2FRMS%20CENTRAL%20REPOSITORY%2FRMS%20IT%20%28%20RMS%2DIT%2Dxx%29%2FRMS%2DIT%2D006%20RMS%20IS%20Risk%20Management&p=true&ga=1)  
Formula: ```Risk Score = Asset Value X Impact X likelihood```

Asset Value: (Score value here - ```<Future Implementation>```)  
(List all the web page, functions or features that involve in this MR.)

Impact: (Score value here - ```<Future Implementation>```)   
(List down all the impact when something wrong happen on this changes or when this changes got bug/error. Write no impact if it not.)  
+ Buyer:  
+ Merchant:  
+ Fiuu:  
+ Bank/Processor:  

Likelihood: (Score value here - ```<Future Implementation>```)  
(For the bug/incident type issue/merge request, mention here how frequent it happen. For others type issue/merge request, just write new implementation.)  
- [ ] New implementation
- [ ] Rare - May only occur in exceptional circumstances; simple process; no previous incidence of non-compliance
- [ ] Unlikely - Could occur at some time; less than 25% chance of occurring; non-complex process &/or existence of checks and balances
- [ ] Possible - Might occur at some time; 25 â€“ 50% chance of occurring; previous audits/reports indicate non-compliance; complex process with extensive checks & balances; impacting factors outside control of organization
- [ ] Likely - Will probably occur in most circumstances; 50-75% chance of occurring; complex process with some checks & balances; impacting factors outside control of organization
- [ ] Almost certain - Can be expected to occur in most circumstances; more than 75% chance of occurring; complex process with minimal checks & balances; impacting factors outside control of organization

Risk Score: (Score value here - ```<Future Implementation>```)
